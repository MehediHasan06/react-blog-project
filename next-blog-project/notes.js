//To create a next boilerplate -> npx create-next-app project-name
//To start a next project -> yarn dev

//Page Structure ----------------------------------------------------

//In pages folder, if I add a component,this'll automatically create a route. The name of the route will be same as the file name. For ex: we've created a "about.js" component in the "pages" folder. Now, if we hit http://localhost:3000/about then we can see that component's view. 
//Again, pages->ninjas->test.js....Then, to access the test page -> http://localhost:3000/ninjas/test
//Again, pages->ninjas->index.js....Then, to access the test page -> http://localhost:3000/ninjas/. Cause the name "index" create a root path for that file.

/* So, Next js generates routes automatically */
